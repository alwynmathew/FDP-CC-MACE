# FDP course materials

Materials for students who attended Faculty Development Programme on *Glide Through Cognitive Computing* 
at Mar Athanasius College of Engineering, Kothamangalam on Dec 16-17, 2019.

Contains python notebooks used on first two days of the hands-on session on Multilayer Perceptron, Convolutional Neural 
Network(CNN) and GANs.

_NOTE: This repo consist of very basic examples for ML/DL beginners. Thus, to make it as 
easy as possible all examples can be directly run on 
[Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) with Google Drive._
